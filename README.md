bcxapi-dotnet
=============

Wrapper for the new Basecamp API in .NET (https://github.com/37signals/bcx-api).

Only provides GET requests right now. Uses dynamic objects for all responses so you won't get intellisense.

We don't automatically refresh the token for you with Basecamp right now after the two week expiration period. Still getting the exact details of that figured out and will push an update soon.
